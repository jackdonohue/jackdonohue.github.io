    <div id="theorytext4"><h2>The Facts</h2><ol><li>The US Military's stated goal is to have full-spectrum dominance by the year of 2020.</li><li>According to the official HAARP website, "HAARP is a scientific endeavor aimed at studying the properties and behavior of the ionosphere, with particular emphasis on being able to understand and use it to enhance communications and surveillance systems for both civilian and defense purposes."</li><li>The ionosphere is the delicate upper layer of our atmosphere which ranges from about 30 miles (50 km) to 600 miles (1,000 km) above the Earth's surface.</li></ol></div>

    <div id="theorytext5"><h2>The Theory</h2><p>It is theorized that HAARP can shoot energy rays up in the air, interacting with our ionosphere which will then cause ELF waves to come back down to earth. Now, these ELF waves can do some pretty scary stuff to humans, like brainwash. The military could use these ELF waves to brainwash our enemies, like North Korea. So, instead of them shooting missles at our country, they could be shooting missles at themselves. If this is all true, than this weapon is known to be one of the more feared weapons in all of the world.</p></div>
    <div id="theorypic6"><img src="ash-over-iceland.jpg"></div>
    <div id="theorytext6"><h2>The Reality</h2><p>The Military refuses anymore further expirementing with HAARP, and it has not been proven that they are still, so I suppose we just have to belive that they really are telling the truth, since they do protect are nation and all, why would they lie about something they were just going to protect us with? </p></div>
