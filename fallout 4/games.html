    <div id="falloutNVinfo"><p><h2>Setting</h2>
    The game is set in and around a post-apocalyptic retro-futuristic Las Vegas, following the Great War between the U.S., and China as a conventional and nuclear war that occurred on October 23, 2077, and lasted less than two hours, while causing immense damage and destruction.</p>

    <h2>Story</h2><p>
    Fallout: New Vegas takes place in 2281, four years after the events of Fallout 3, thirty-nine years after Fallout 2, one-hundred and twenty years after Fallout and six years before the events of Fallout 4. The New California Republic plays a major part in the game's story, being in a three-way struggle amongst the Caesar's Legion slavers, and the mysterious Mr. House.
The Courier, the player's character, was meant to deliver a package from Primm to New Vegas. However, they are intercepted by the Great Khans led by a mysterious man, who shoots them and takes the package, leaving the Courier for dead in a shallow grave. The Courier is later found by a robot named Victor, and is taken to the settlement of Goodsprings, where Doctor Mitchell saves their life. After the Courier is given some medical tests, the player is pushed back into the open world, and the quest Ain't That a Kick in the Head begins. Fallout: New Vegas has a definitive ending, unlike Fallout 3.
