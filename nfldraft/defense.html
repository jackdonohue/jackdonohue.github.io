  <div id="bosainfo"><h2>Joey Bosa, 3rd Overall Pick</h2></div>
  <div id="bosainfo2"><p>Has an NFL-­ready frame. Good muscular definition and flexibility to go along with a confident, competitive attitude. Solid upfield burst off the snap. Has booming power in his hands. Uses arm extension and forward lean as his primary weapon. Generates speed-­to-­power bullrush and plays off of that with a punch and pull technique that pulls tackles off-­balance. Focuses pass rush attack on outside shoulder of tackle using forward lean and aggressive hand play. Active hands can completely wipe out a tackles weak outside hand allowing him to cave-­in the edge. Usually gets hands on defender first. Able to stack and slide along line of scrimmage in pursuit of ball­-carrier. Strong core and able to rag­ doll tight ends who arent committed to the fight. Adequate closing burst to the ball. Looks fluid and nimble when dropping into space. Has the talent and traits to be used more aggressively than he was at Ohio State. Grew as a run defender this season. Has forced five fumbles over the last two years. Football is in his blood with a father who was drafted by Dolphins in first round of 1987 draft and an uncle who played at Ohio State in the mid­-80s. Motor will never be a problem.</p></div>
